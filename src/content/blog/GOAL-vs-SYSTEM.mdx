### 🎯 Goal vs. 🔄 System – *Atomic Habits* Style

#### 🧭 **What is a Goal?**

A **goal** is the **desired outcome** you want to achieve.  
It’s **future-focused** — something you aim to reach.

🗂️ **Examples:**
- ✍️ *"I will write a book."*
- 🏃‍♂️ *"I will exercise regularly."*

👉 Goals give you **direction**, but they don’t tell you how to get there.

#### ⚙️ **What is a System?**

A **system** is the **routine or process** you follow consistently.  
It’s **present-focused** — about what you **do daily**.

🔁 **Examples:**
- 💪 *"I will do 10 push-ups every day."*
- 🧠 *"I will write 500 words each morning."*

👉 Systems drive **progress**, even when motivation fades.

#### 🧠💡 Identity Shift: The *Real* Habit Secret

Most people think habit-building is just about **consistency**…  
But the *real foundation* is your **identity**.

> "You don’t rise to the level of your goals.  
> You fall to the level of your systems."  
> — *James Clear*

If you believe:
- 👤 *“I’m a fit person”* → You’ll enjoy exercise.
- 🙁 *“Exercise is suffering”* → You’ll avoid it.

🎭 To build lasting habits, **become the person** who does the habit.  
Not just someone trying to do it.

### ✅ Key idea

- 🌟 **Goals** = What you want  
- 🛠️ **Systems** = How you get it  
- 👁️ **Identity** = Who you become
