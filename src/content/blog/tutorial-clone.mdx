## ðŸ§° STEP 1: Required Tools

### 1. Install Git

Git is used to **pull or push code** to your GitHub account. Itâ€™s an essential tool for managing code.

### 2. Install pnpm

`pnpm` is a **package manager** that helps you install JavaScript packages efficiently.

### 3. Create an SSH Key

SSH stands for **Secure Shell**. It allows your computer to **connect to GitHub securely**.

There are two keys: a **private key** and a **public key**. Copy the **public key** and paste it into your GitHub account.

You can test the connection using:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```
