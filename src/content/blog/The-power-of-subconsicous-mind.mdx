# 🧠 How to Use the Power of Your Brain

Everyone has a brain — but not everyone knows how to use it effectively. To truly unlock your potential, you need to understand the **two levels of the mind**:

## 🧩 What is the Conscious Mind?

The **conscious mind** is the part of your brain responsible for **rational thinking, logic, and decision-making**. It's what you're aware of in the present moment — like reading this sentence, solving a math problem, or making a to-do list.

## 🌊 What is the Subconscious Mind?

The **subconscious mind** operates **beneath your awareness**. It controls:
- Repeated behaviors (like habits)
- Emotional responses
- Automatic thoughts

Unlike the conscious mind, it's not rational — it just follows whatever patterns it’s been taught, whether helpful or harmful.

## 🔋 What Is the Power of the Subconscious Mind?

> 🧠 Research estimates that **about 90% of your daily behavior** is controlled by the subconscious mind.

That includes:
- Checking your phone without thinking
- Driving a car on autopilot
- Feeling pessimistic without knowing why

**💡 Conclusion:**  
If you can change your subconscious programming, you can change the majority of your behavior — and, therefore, your life.

## 🧠 Why Does the Brain Rely on the Subconscious Mind?

Because it saves **mental energy**.  
The brain prefers:
- ⚙️ **Efficiency**
- 🔁 **Predictability**

**Habits are stored in the basal ganglia**, a deep part of the brain that automates behavior so you don’t have to think about every little thing. That’s why habits feel “automatic.”

## 🔁 How to Use the Power of the Subconscious Mind?

The **subconscious mind doesn’t judge** what is true or false — it simply accepts repeated input as truth.

### ✅ So what should you do?

1. **Feed it new thoughts or actions** you want to adopt.
2. **Repeat them consistently** (affirmations, journaling, visualizing, practicing habits).
3. Let your subconscious **normalize the pattern**.
4. It will eventually **automate the new behavior** for you.

> 🌱 *What you plant in your subconscious, you will harvest in your life.*
